### About this project

My first solo React project, using a get request to get data from an external API. I coded along with a pro developer on Youtube in order to solidify my understanding of why things happen. I am trying to gain a deeper understanding of React components, props and state. This project manages to incorporate all of these as well as getting data from an api.

The video was split into these following sections:
- Exploring the API
- Setting up our React App
- Getting data into our App
- Selecting Levels
- Mapping out questions onto cards
- Checking for correct Answers and adding to arrays using useState
- Disabling multiple buttons with React Hooks
- Displaying the score
- Styling
- .env files in React

I have added annd played around with the stayling to make it look more appealing and user friendly.
